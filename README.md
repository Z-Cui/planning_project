# Planning Project

This project aims to compare the SAT planners, and to understand the differences behind these planners.

- SatPlan: https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/satplan/index.htm
- Madagascar: https://research.ics.aalto.fi/software/sat/madagascar/

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle problem is chosen for this project, because it is one of the easiest NP-hard problems to implement for planner benchmarking.

# PDDL files

- The domain definition is in the file "domain-hanoi.pddl".
- The problem definition is generated by the python program "hanoi_problem_generator.py", for example, please launch this program with "python hanoi_problem_generator.py 4 > hanoi4.pddl" to create a Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks. 

# How to re-applicate?

I used an Ubuntu virtual machine, and I tested the planners with the commands in the file "commands_in_terminal".

Please download the planners and put them with PDDL files to test planners.
